          New data collected by The Marshall Project/Slate offers a glimpse into the political thinkings of an overlooked segment of the U.S. population: prisoners.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          What are their thoughts on what's been dubbed the most important election of our lifetime? How do, or did, they view the slew of democratic candidates that stepped up to the plate? Do they like Trump?
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Some results were surprising. One takeaway? Trump is surprisingly popular among the prison population. Of the 2020 candidates, he was the most popular overall. Candidates liked him slightly more than Bernie Sanders, and significantly more
          than Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg.
        </p>

        <p class="g-copy">
          The data also challenged the widely held conception that inmates are Democrats. Most were Independent, and the margin between Democrats and Republicans was thin enough to be statistically insignificant.

          Also interesting was how prisoners said they got their news. A significant majority said they watched Local News. Few, if any, said they listen to radio, and more listened to TV news than did read newspapers.

          Currently, just two states (Maine and Vermont) allow all prisoners to vote, regardless of their conviction. In all 48 others, prisoners lose the right to vote when they become incarcerated. And just 15 states automatically restore those
          rights upon release.
